This a Recipe of making a Red Velvet Cake along with its Ingredients.

Ingredients:
2 cups plus 2 tablespoons (250 grams) cake flour

1/2 teaspoon (2 grams) salt

2 tablespoons (15 grams) regular unsweetened or Dutch-processed unsweetened cocoa powder

1/2 cup (113 grams) unsalted butter, at room temperature

1 1/2 cups (300 grams) granulated white sugar

2 large (100 grams) eggs, at room temperature

1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract

1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk, at room temperature

2 tablespoons (22 grams) liquid red food coloring (I use McCormick's brand)

1 teaspoon (4 grams) white distilled vinegar

1 teaspoon (4 grams) baking soda

8 ounces (227 grams) cream cheese, at room temperature

8 ounces (227 grams) Mascarpone cheese, at room temperature

1 teaspoon (4 grams) pure vanilla extract

1 cup (115 grams) confectioners' (icing or powdered) sugar, sifted

1 1/4 cups (300 ml) cold heavy whipping cream (cream with a 35-40% butterfat content)


For Cake:
Heat oven to 350°F | 175°C. Lightly grease two 8-inch cake pans with butter or nonstick oil spray and lightly dust with 1 tablespoon of the sifted cocoa powder.
Cream butter and sugar together until light in colour. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition to combine well.
In a smaller bowl, mix together oil, remaining cocoa powder, red food colouring and vanilla until smooth. Stir colour mixture and vinegar through the creamed sugar mixture to combine.
Sift together flour, baking soda and salt in a separate bowl. Add half of the dry ingredients and half of the buttermilk to the wet ingredients; mix well. Repeat with remaining dry ingredients and buttermilk. 

Divide batter among the 2 prepared pans and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack completely.

For Cream Cheese Frosting:
Beat together cream cheese, butter and vanilla until smooth lighter in colour (about 3-4 minutes). Beat in icing sugar until frosting is light and fluffy (if frosting is too thin, add more icing sugar and beat again until reaching your desired consistency).
Optional if using: mix in the lemon juice.

Assemble Cake:
Transfer 1 cake onto a serving dish/plate, flat-side down. Trim the top dome off of the cake to create a flat bottom later. Scoop about 1 1/2 - 2 cups of frosting onto cake and spread evenly over the top.
Place second cake layer on top and use remaining frosting to cover top and sides of cake.
Crumble trimmed pieces of cake to decorate.
